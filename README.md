# GradeExercise - Flow Control Study

## Overview
Welcome to my GradeExercise Java program repository! This project showcases my journey as a Java learner and my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, particularly Control Flow. This simple Java console application allows a user to input student grades, calculate averages, and provide final results based on those grades.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by prompting the user to press '1' to begin.
2. It then collects the student's name and checks if it's entered. If not, it prompts the user to provide the student's name.
3. The program also collects the degree information if the student's name is provided.
4. Next, the program collects three different grades from the user: Test 1, Test 2, and Activities.
5. After gathering the grades, the program calculates the average of the three grades.
6. Depending on the calculated average, the program determines whether the student is approved, needs to retake a test, or has failed.
7. Finally, the program offers the option to view the final results or end the session.

## Control Flow Explanation
The concept of Control Flow plays a crucial role in this program. It allows the program to make decisions and follow different paths based on conditions. Here are a few examples from the code:

1. The program uses an `if` statement to check whether the student's name is provided. If it's provided, the program proceeds to collect the degree information. If not, it asks for the student's name again.
2. Another `if` statement calculates the student's final result based on the average calculated. The program determines if the student is approved, needs to retake a test, or has failed, and prints the appropriate message.

## Learning Journey
As a Java learner, I'm gaining proficiency in understanding how Java programs are structured, how user input can be collected, and how logical decisions can be made using Control Flow mechanisms. This project reflects my progress and eagerness to apply my learning to real-world scenarios.

I'm excited to continue my Java learning journey, building more complex applications, and exploring deeper programming concepts.
